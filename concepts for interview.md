Here‚Äôs a tight, exhaustive checklist of what they‚Äôre likely to expect from you (based on the convo). Use it as your Round-2 prep map.

# A) JavaScript & Node.js (Core)

- **Closures**: definition, typical pitfalls, practical uses (encapsulation, factories).
- **Event Loop**

  - Browser: microtasks vs macrotasks; render tick.
  - Node: libuv phases (timers ‚Üí pending ‚Üí poll ‚Üí check), `process.nextTick` vs Promise microtasks, `setImmediate` vs `setTimeout`.
  - Ordering examples.

- **Concurrency Patterns**

  - `Promise.all` vs `allSettled` vs `any` vs `race` (+ use-cases).
  - ‚ÄúReturn as they finish‚Äù strategies (streaming/SSE/WebSocket).

- **Worker Threads vs Async I/O**

  - When workers help (CPU-bound) vs when they don‚Äôt (I/O-bound).

- **Error handling**

  - Async error propagation, unhandled rejections, centralized error middleware.

# B) TypeScript & OOP (They signaled this clearly)

- **Interfaces**: contracts, `implements`, optional/readonly, structural typing.
- **Classes**: access modifiers, inheritance vs composition, abstract classes.
- **Generics**: interface/class/function generics; constraint patterns.
- **OOP pillars**: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism (with tiny examples).
- **Interface-driven design**: swappable implementations (e.g., Storage, Notifier, PaymentGateway).

# C) File I/O & Streams

- **Buffer vs Stream**: definitions, backpressure, memory profile, when to choose which.
- **Node streams API**: Readable/Writable/Transform, `pipeline`/`finished`.
- **Large file flows**: chunked upload/download, hashing while streaming, range requests.
- **Combining buffer+stream**: small header buffering with streamed body.

# D) Databases (SQL & MongoDB)

- **Indexing strategy**

  - Index WHERE/JOIN/ORDER BY columns; selectivity; composite index order.
  - Covering indexes, partial indexes (SQL), TTL/index types (Mongo).
  - Reading EXPLAIN/`explain()` at a high level.

- **Connection pooling**

  - Why pools; typical knobs (min/max, idle timeout, acquire timeout).
  - Mongo URI options: `maxPoolSize`, `minPoolSize`, timeouts.

- **Schema design**

  - SQL normalization vs Mongo embed vs reference; hot-path modeling.

- **Migrations**

  - SQL‚ÜíMongo approach: dual-write/CDC, parity checks, rollback plan, feature flags.

# E) Caching Architecture (Redis)

- **Topology**: single shared Redis across all app instances (why).
- **Patterns**: read-through, write-through, write-behind, explicit invalidation.
- **Key design**: versioned keys, key patterns, namespacing.
- **TTL strategy**: jittered TTL, cache stampede prevention (mutex/dog-pile).
- **Consistency**: handling concurrent updates, stale reads expectations.

# F) Cloud & AWS (what you mentioned)

- **S3**

  - Store object **key** in DB (not full URL).
  - Generate **presigned URLs** with expiry; IAM least privilege; lifecycle/expiry policies.

- **Lambda vs EC2**

  - Cold starts, time limits, concurrency vs always-on, control surface.
  - When a small API can live on API Gateway + Lambda.

- **CloudWatch ‚Üí SNS**

  - Metrics (e.g., CPUUtilization), thresholds/periods, creating alarms, wiring to SNS topics, notifications (console/CLI/IaC).

# G) System Design Lite (likely prompt)

- **Design a file upload/download service**

  - Presigned S3, streaming uploads, metadata store, Redis for metadata cache, indexes for hot queries.

- **Read-heavy endpoint optimization**

  - Index choice, caching, pagination, partial responses, backpressure, rate limiting.

# H) Testing & Ops

- **Testing layers**: unit vs integration vs contract tests; mocking external deps; TS types aiding tests.
- **Observability**: structured logs, correlation IDs, basic dashboards/alerts.
- **Rollback/Feature flags**: safe deploys during DB migrations.

# I) Security & Robustness

- **Input validation** (Zod/Joi), output schemas.
- **Idempotency & retries** (backoff/jitter), rate limiting.
- **S3 presigned URL safety**: short expiries, path scoping, HTTPS only.

# J) Docker (light but nice to have)

- **Basics**: Dockerfile for Node, multi-stage builds, small image, env configs.

---

## ‚ÄúMust-know one-liners‚Äù they‚Äôll expect you to say cleanly

- **Interface (TS):** ‚ÄúDefines a contract/shape; enables polymorphism and swappable implementations without changing callers.‚Äù
- **Indexing:** ‚ÄúIndex the columns used to **filter/join/sort**; composite index order follows the most selective leading condition.‚Äù
- **Streams:** ‚ÄúUse streams for large/unknown size‚Äîchunked, backpressure-aware; keeps memory flat.‚Äù
- **Return-as-they-finish:** ‚ÄúIndependent operations shouldn‚Äôt block each other‚Äîuse streaming or `Promise.any/allSettled`.‚Äù
- **Redis topology:** ‚ÄúOne shared Redis across all instances to keep cache consistent; invalidate explicitly or with versioned keys.‚Äù
- **S3 links:** ‚ÄúStore object key; generate a short-lived presigned URL per request.‚Äù

---

### Summary (your action focus)

1. TS/OOP interfaces + tiny generic examples.
2. Event-loop ordering (browser & Node), `nextTick` vs microtasks.
3. Concurrency answers that stream/emit results as they resolve.
4. Buffer vs Stream, `pipeline`, backpressure.
5. Indexing & pooling specifics; quick EXPLAIN talk-through.
6. Redis patterns & single-cache rationale.
7. S3 presigned URL flow + CloudWatch‚ÜíSNS alarm wiring.

If you want, I can turn this into a 2-page printable checklist + a small TS repo with ready code snippets (interfaces, `any/allSettled`, stream‚ÜíS3, presigned URLs).
