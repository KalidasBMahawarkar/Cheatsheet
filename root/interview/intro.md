Hi, myself Kalidas Mahawarkar, I am Backend Engineer with over 5 years of experience building cloud-native, scalable backend systems.

I completed my Bachelor’s in Computer Science from Mumbai University with an 8.3 CGPA.

My core expertise lies in Node.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, and cloud services like AWS and GCP.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked on multiple high-impact projects — from migrating legacy PHP modules to modern nodejs and expressjs also working on microservices to designingAPIs and systems that improved both performance and reliability.

I’m passionate about building systems that are clean, efficient, and business-aligned
